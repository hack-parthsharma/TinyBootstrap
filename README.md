# tiny-bootstrap

This is a tiny, fully working "bootloader" for x86 IBM-PC computers, which basically does nothing more than print some text to the screen. Mostly a teaching tool. If you just want to see it in action though, just run

     bochs -f bochsrc.txt

which runs bochs with the correct config file.
